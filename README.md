# UoftHacks-11
Project my and I worked on for UoftHacks11. It originated from a simple idea: to turn memories into thrilling, exciting stories. Memento's webapp allows users to create collections of photos that can be then summarized with prompts and a special rewind-story that gives some background to the collection. We used taipy.io to create the frontend and backend of the project, and thanks to Cohere AI, we were able to generate exciting rewind-stories from user-inputted prompts.
